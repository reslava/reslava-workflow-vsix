# 🧵 Loom

**Your AI agent's long-term memory.**

Loom is a document-driven workflow system that gives AI agents persistent context, structured
workflow state, and approval gates — so multi-session development stays coherent.

> *"AI agents are stateless. Loom is the memory layer that makes them not."*

## The Problem

AI-assisted development degrades over time. Session 1 is the best session — the AI is aligned,
decisions get made, code gets written. By session 10, the AI has forgotten everything from
sessions 2 through 9. You either re-explain context every time (expensive) or the AI makes
suggestions that contradict earlier decisions (damaging).

The cause isn't model quality — it's that there's no persistent memory of what was decided and why.

## What Loom Does

Loom stores project memory as a typed, linked markdown document graph:

```
weaves/
  {weave}/                     ← workstream (e.g. "auth", "payment-system")
    ctx.md                     ← AI-generated weave summary
    {thread}/                  ← feature thread
      {thread}-idea.md         ← raw concept
      {thread}-design.md       ← design decisions and conversation log
      plans/
        {plan-id}.md           ← implementation steps table
      done/
        {done-id}.md           ← post-implementation summary
      ctx/                     ← AI-generated thread summary
      chats/                   ← AI conversation logs
weaves/ctx.md                  ← global project summary (read first every session)
references/                    ← static architectural facts (architecture.md, etc.)
```

Every document has typed frontmatter. Status is derived from documents — there is no central state
file. Changes are versioned in git.

## How AI Agents Use Loom

Loom exposes its document graph as an **MCP server** (Model Context Protocol). Any MCP-compatible
agent — Claude Code, Cursor, Continue, Cline — can read and write Loom state via standard tools.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "loom": {
      "command": "loom",
      "args": ["mcp"],
      "env": { "LOOM_ROOT": "${workspaceFolder}" }
    }
  }
}
```

The agent owns code execution. Loom owns workflow state. Each stays in its lane.

### Key resources (read-only)

| Resource | What it returns |
|----------|----------------|
| `loom://thread-context/{weaveId}/{threadId}` | Bundled idea + design + active plan + ctx — the complete "what am I working on" payload |
| `loom://state?weaveId=&threadId=` | Full project state JSON, filterable |
| `loom://plan/{id}` | Plan doc with parsed steps array |
| `loom://requires-load/{id}` | Recursively resolved context chain |
| `loom://diagnostics` | Broken links, dangling references |

### Key tools (state mutations)

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `loom_complete_step` | Mark a plan step done (idempotent) |
| `loom_create_idea / design / plan / chat` | Create Loom documents |
| `loom_update_doc` | Rewrite doc content, preserve frontmatter |
| `loom_promote` | idea → design → plan, chat → idea |
| `loom_refresh_ctx` | Regenerate ctx summary via AI sampling |
| `loom_get_stale_docs` | List all docs whose parent has been updated since last generation |

### Key prompts (guided workflows)

| Prompt | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| `do-next-step` | Loads the active plan step + all required context; primary "do work" entry point |
| `continue-thread` | Loads thread context and proposes the next action |
| `weave-idea / design / plan` | Guided document creation via AI sampling |

## The Workflow

```
1. Idea      → raw concept, rough scope
2. Design    → decisions, trade-offs, rejected alternatives, conversation log
3. Plan      → numbered implementation steps, each reviewable
4. Implement → agent executes one step at a time, marking progress
5. Done      → post-implementation summary, links to what was built
```

Human approves each phase transition. The agent never advances without a checkpoint.

**Staleness detection:** when a design is updated, linked plans are flagged stale. The agent sees
the warning and knows to re-read the design before implementing. Context can't silently drift.

**`requires_load`:** documents declare their own dependencies. Before working on any doc, the agent
reads everything in its `requires_load` chain. It can't miss context it doesn't know exists.

## VS Code Extension

The VS Code extension is the **human surface** over the same document graph:

- Tree view: weaves → threads → plans, chats, done docs
- Inline buttons: rename, archive, delete
- Toolbar commands: Weave Idea, Weave Design, Weave Plan, Start Plan
- AI buttons (when MCP connected): Weave Idea, Weave Design, AI Reply — powered by MCP sampling

## Architecture

```
cli / vscode / mcp  →  app (use-cases)  →  core (domain) + fs (infrastructure)
```

- **`core`**: Pure domain logic — entities, reducers, events, validation. No IO.
- **`app`**: Orchestration use-cases. All state changes go through here.
- **`fs`**: Infrastructure — file IO, frontmatter parsing, link index, repositories.
- **`cli`**: Thin delivery layer — command parsing, console output.
- **`vscode`**: Human surface — tree view, commands, toolbar.
- **`mcp`**: Agent surface — MCP resources, tools, prompts, sampling. *(v0.5.0)*

No layer imports upward. All MCP tools delegate to `app` — no bypassing.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install -g @reslava/loom

# Initialize Loom in your project
cd my-project
loom init

# Create your first idea
loom weave idea "Add Dark Mode" --weave ui

# Check project state
loom status
```

## Why MCP (not a custom AI integration)

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open standard for AI agent tool integration — Anthropic-published
but supported by Cursor, Continue, Cline, and others. Implementing once exposes Loom to every
MCP-compatible agent.

The agent owns code execution, bash, file edits, search — everything a coding agent already does
well. Loom owns workflow state. Single billing via the user's existing agent connection. No separate
API keys.
