### Happy full path
idea -> design -> plans
and user can create whatever he needs at first, and link them later if he consider

i don't know what your actual idea about docs workflow 
could you tell me?

## AI:

My understanding of the workflow, as it stands in the code today:

**The canonical happy path is:**
```
weaveIdea  →  weaveDesign  →  weavePlan  →  startPlan  →  completeStep(s)
```

Each step produces a Markdown doc with frontmatter. The docs reference each other through `parent_id` / `child_ids`. `getState()` reads all of them and derives the current state — nothing is stored anywhere else.

**The anchor-free part** means Rafa doesn't have to follow that order. You can:
- Create a plan before a design exists
- Create an idea and link it to an existing design later
- Leave `parent_id: null` indefinitely

The system doesn't enforce the chain — it just supports it. The links are optional metadata, not gates.

**What I was doing before you stopped me** was fixing stale `threads/` → `weaves/` references in `init.ts`, `setup.ts`, and `pathUtils.ts`. I also hit a build error: `cli/weavePlan.ts` and `vscode/weavePlan.ts` both reference `result.autoFinalizedDesign` which no longer exists in the `app/weavePlan` return type. That's a leftover from before the anchor-free migration — the old code auto-finalized the design when you created a plan; the new code doesn't.

I stopped because you wanted to talk first. What's the question — is it about the `autoFinalizedDesign` removal, the overall workflow model, or something else?

## Rafa:
Should anchor-free also autofinalize the deisgn when a plan is created?
I have so many things in my head that I can not remember my last decision design about this.
Read the design before I implemented anchor-free: weaves/core-engine/anchor-free-threads-design.md

Tell what you think, your opinion and conclusions?

## AI:

**Short answer: No. Auto-finalization is incompatible with anchor-free. Remove it.**

---

**What the design says**

The anchor-free design (`anchor-free-threads-design.md`) makes no mention of auto-finalization anywhere. The `weave plan` command is described as:

> Creates a plan in the given thread. If `--parent` is provided, links to that document.

No condition on the design's status. No forced transitions. The explicit design principle is **Zero Friction Creation** — "commands create the thread directory if it doesn't exist. No prerequisites."

Auto-finalizing a design when a plan is created is the opposite of that: it's a side-effect the user didn't ask for, triggered by a creation command. That's the old linear workflow behavior.

---

**Why the old code had it**

The old model enforced `idea → design → plan` as a strict chain. `weavePlan` would:
1. Check a finalized design exists
2. If the design was still `draft`, auto-finalize it (convenience)
3. Create the plan linked to that design

That made sense in the linear model because a plan *required* a finalized design as its parent. In anchor-free, plans have no prerequisites — `parent_id` is optional. There's no design to auto-finalize, and if there is one, the user decides when it's ready.

---

**My conclusion**

The `autoFinalizedDesign` field is correctly gone from `app/weavePlan`. The CLI and vscode command references to it are dead code from before the migration. The fix is to delete those references — which is exactly what I was doing when you stopped me.

The happy path stays:
```
weaveIdea → weaveDesign → weavePlan → startPlan → completeStep(s)
```

But finalization is now a deliberate user action (`loom finalize <id>`), not a side-effect of the next step in the chain. That's the right call.

Ready to continue the fix and rebuild when you say so.

## Rafa:
### anchor-free workflow app functionality and related CLI, vscode commands
This is very important and has been changing since I've starting this project and now with your help I need we settle down all possibilities before continue.
The idea of this project comes from a previous project I developed with yoy and the manual workflow I designed to collaborate with you. Now I want to automatize and improve it. 

For the examples I will mention I will use VSCode extension situation.
VSCode extension has a toolbar with weave create docs commands, grouping, filter... AI enabled / disabled state button. Also have a tree view, each doc node will have inline buttons to launch associated actions, visible or hidden deppending on the state. Inline actions: finalize, create linked design/plan (will use AI or not depending on AIT toolbar button state)
1. User can create docs freely associated or not with a weave or a thread
   If user selected a weave an click on toolbar weave Idea, we create an idea within the weave, if next write and finalize it, also create the corresponding thread with final Id.   
    
2. User can craate a doc linked to its parent. Example,
    VSCode, user select an idea and click on inline button create a linked design and then click on write plan with AI Enabled, AI will create the linked plan.

What you think?

## AI:

The model you're describing is coherent and the architecture already supports most of it. Let me map it out clearly, flag one open question, and give my opinion on each part.

---

### How the two key concepts relate

A **weave** is a directory (`weaves/{name}/`). Its name is stable — set at creation time, never changes.
A **document** (idea, design, plan) lives inside that directory and has its own ID lifecycle: temp → permanent via `finalize`.

These are independent. The weave name is the thread identity. The document ID is just the file's name.

This is the right architecture. No renaming of directories needed.

---

### Flow 1 — Free creation with weave selected

> "User selects a weave and clicks toolbar Weave Idea → idea created in weave. User writes and finalizes → thread gets proper structure with final Id."

**What happens today:**
- `weaveIdea("Title", { weave: "vscode-extension" })` creates `weaves/vscode-extension/new-{ts}-idea.md`
- User edits the file
- User clicks Finalize → `finalize(tempId)` renames the file to `vscode-extension-idea.md`, updates internal `id` field

The weave directory never changes. Only the file inside it gets renamed. This is already correct.

**When no weave is selected:** The extension needs to either (a) prompt "Which weave?" or (b) derive a weave name from the title. My recommendation: **prompt for weave name** — it's one extra input and prevents silent naming surprises. The toolbar "Weave Idea" button without a weave selected should open: first a weave picker (existing weaves + "New…"), then a title input.

---

### Flow 2 — Inline linked creation

> "User selects an idea → clicks inline Create Design → clicks Write Plan with AI enabled → AI creates the linked plan."

This maps directly to:
1. **Idea node → `[Create Design]`** → `weaveDesign(weaveId, { parent: ideaId })` → creates design, auto-finalizes the idea if temp (user clicked "create design from this idea" — that's deliberate commitment)
2. **Design node → `[Create Plan]`** with AI enabled → call AI use-case with design content as context → AI generates plan body → `weavePlan(weaveId, { parent: designId, content: aiGenerated })`

**What's already built:** Step 1 works today — `weaveDesign` auto-finalizes a temp idea and sets `parent_id`. Step 2 is not built — `weavePlan` doesn't accept a `parent` param yet and there's no AI use-case.

**My opinion on auto-finalize in step 1:** Keep it. The user explicitly clicked "Create linked design from this idea." That's a commitment signal — auto-finalizing the idea at that point is correct UX, not a surprise. It's different from the old `weavePlan` auto-finalize which happened two hops up without explicit user intent.

---

### The AI enabled/disabled toggle

This is a `ViewState.aiEnabled` boolean. When `false`, creation commands use template generators (today's behavior). When `true`, they call an AI use-case that takes the context (parent doc content) and generates a richer body.

**Not yet built**, but the architecture is ready: it's a flag in `ViewState` that command handlers read before deciding which path to take. No structural change needed.

---

### What needs to be settled before building

One open question: **does `weavePlan` need a `parent` parameter?**

Today: `weavePlan(weaveId)` — plan has `parent_id: null`. User links manually.
With Flow 2: `weavePlan(weaveId, { parent: designId })` — plan is linked to the design at creation.

I think `weavePlan` should accept an optional `--parent <id>` and set `parent_id` when provided. This is anchor-free (still optional, not required) but makes the linked flow ergonomic. The CLI already has `--parent` in the design doc command tables; `weavePlan` just needs to implement it.

---

### Summary of what's built vs what's missing

| Feature | State |
|---------|-------|
| Free idea creation in weave (toolbar) | ✅ Built |
| Finalize idea (inline button) | ✅ Built (`app/finalize`) |
| Create linked design from idea (auto-finalizes idea) | ✅ Built (`weaveDesign`) |
| Create plan (anchor-free, no parent) | ✅ Built (`weavePlan`) |
| Create linked plan with explicit parent | ❌ Missing (`--parent` param in `weavePlan`) |
| Weave picker prompt (no weave selected) | ❌ Missing (VS Code UX) |
| AI enabled/disabled toggle in toolbar | ❌ Missing (ViewState + commands) |
| AI-generated content in creation commands | ❌ Missing (AI use-case) |

The `--parent` addition to `weavePlan` is small and I'd do it before implementing the extension commands — it's the foundation for Flow 2. Everything else on the missing list is either VS Code UX or AI (post-MVP).

Agree?

## Rafa:
In my last design I included weaves an threads concepts, read `weaves/core-engine/weave-and-thread-design.md`
Tell me if this make sense to you?

## AI:

Yes, the design makes sense — the metaphor is solid and the two-level hierarchy is a natural evolution. Let me give you my honest assessment.

---

### What it introduces

The design adds a second level to the filesystem:

```
weaves/                          ← root
  core-engine/                   ← Weave (project container)
    state-management/            ← Thread (workstream)
      state-management-idea.md
      state-management-design.md
      plans/
    event-bus/                   ← Thread (workstream)
    loose-idea.md                ← Loose fiber (unassigned)
```

vs. the **current flat model** in the code:

```
weaves/
  core-engine/                   ← treated as both weave AND thread
    core-engine-idea.md
    plans/
  vscode-extension/              ← treated as both weave AND thread
    vscode-extension-design.md
    plans/
```

The current code has no concept of a Weave as a container. Every folder under `weaves/` IS the thread. The two-level model is a structural change, not just a rename.

---

### What's good about it

1. **The metaphor holds.** Loom → Weave → Thread → Fiber maps cleanly onto tool → project → workstream → document. It's intuitive and scales.

2. **Loose fibers are elegant.** Unassigned docs at the Weave root give you anchor-free capture without polluting any Thread. You can dump ideas freely and organize later.

3. **Complexity scales correctly.** Today `core-engine/` mixes anchor-free plan docs, design docs, and done/ together in one flat pile. With Threads, each workstream gets its own folder and its own clear narrative.

4. **The "one idea → one design → N plans" constraint per Thread is correct.** It keeps Threads focused. Multiple design alternatives → separate Threads linked via `parent_id`. That's the right call.

---

### The honest tension

**The current repo doesn't follow this structure yet — including the design docs themselves.**

`weaves/core-engine/` has `anchor-free-threads-design.md`, `weave-and-thread-design.md`, `core-engine-idea.md` etc. all sitting flat in the root. It IS the current-style flat thread. Under the new model, each of those topics would be a Thread subfolder.

This isn't a blocker, but it means Phase 4 is a migration that touches every existing weave directory, all the code that scans `weaves/{name}/` directly, `loadThread`, `buildLinkIndex`, `findThreadPath`, `getState`, the CLI, and the VS Code tree provider.

The design's own sequencing is correct: **Phase 4 deferred until after VS Code extension core is stable.** Building the extension on the current flat model, then doing Phase 4 as a contained structural upgrade, is the right order.

---

### Where this leaves the current work

The summary table I gave you in the previous message is still valid — with one addition: `weavePlan --parent` and the weave picker are Phase 3/current work. Phase 4 (Thread subdirectories) is future.

For now, `weaves/{name}/` = flat thread = what we're building against. The `weave-and-thread-design.md` is the north star but doesn't change today's implementation path.

---

**To directly answer your question:** yes, it makes sense. The design is well-thought-out. The only thing I'd flag is that the existing docs in `weaves/` don't yet reflect the new structure — but that's expected since Phase 4 is deferred. Continue with the extension, then migrate.

Agree on that sequencing?

## Rafa:
Yes, we will continue with the extension now that you read `weave-and-thread-design.md` and we will test in other loom, not in the current repo.

Current repo is just a try to emulate Loom manually conforming we design it, but it is not important that do not align 100% because Loom design evloved a lot.

The important point is having Loom workflow clear to implement it in core,fs,app - cli,vscode correctly and test its functionality in test Looms

When I run the extension or CLI commands we will use a local loom in j:/temp or any subdir

Also the plans:
weaves/vscode-extension/plans/vscode-extension-plan-004.md
weaves/vscode-extension/plans/vscode-extension-plan-005.md
weaves/vscode-extension/plans/vscode-extension-plan-006.md
were created before anchor-free and `weave-and-thread-design.md`
should we update the plans? create a new ones? append a new one?
what you consider?

## AI:

**Don't create new plans. Append revision notes to 004; leave 005/006 as-is for now.**

Here's my reasoning:

---

**Plan-004** is partially done (steps 1–4 ✅, step 5 next). The plan has stale code snippets in steps 5–6 — they reference `threads/` in the watcher glob and the old `autoFinalizedDesign` field. But those are example code in the plan doc, not what we'll actually write. When we implement step 5, we write against the current API regardless of what the snippet says.

What I'd do: add a short `## Revision Notes` section at the bottom of plan-004 recording what changed since it was written. That keeps the plan honest without rewriting it. The ✅/🔳 step table stays the same — progress tracking is still valid.

**Plans 005 and 006** are draft and untouched. When we reach them we'll update their content to match the weave-and-thread model and the anchor-free API. No point touching them now.

**The weave-and-thread two-level model** (Weave → Thread subdirs) doesn't affect the extension MVP at all — it's Phase 4, deferred. Plans 004/005/006 cover Phase 3 work. The tree view for the MVP can treat `weaves/{name}/` as a flat thread exactly as it does today.

---

**So the plan:**
1. Add revision notes to plan-004 (2 min)
2. Proceed with step 5 — implement remaining commands against current API
3. Leave 005/006 untouched until we get there

Ready to do that?
