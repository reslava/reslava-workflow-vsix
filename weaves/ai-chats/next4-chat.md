## Rafa:
test-vscode.sh - all 7 passed OK

should we start with big refactor weave -> threads?
or we need to do something before?
tell me
## AI:

Good moment to assess. Here's where things stand:

**Phase 3 cleanup — already done.** `getPrimaryDesign()` and `validateSinglePrimaryDesign` are gone from the codebase. Nothing blocking there.

**Phase 4 (the real refactor) — not started.** `weave-and-thread-plan-001.md` doesn't exist yet. Before touching code, we need that plan.

---

### What Phase 4 actually means

It's not a rename. It's a **filesystem layout change**:

```
Before (current):
weaves/vscode-extension/
  vscode-extension-design.md   ← flat
  plans/vscode-extension-plan-008.md

After (Phase 4):
weaves/vscode-extension/
  toolbar/                    ← Thread subdirectory
    toolbar-design.md
    plans/toolbar-plan-001.md
  tree-view/                  ← another Thread
    tree-view-design.md
  loose-fiber.md              ← still allowed at weave root
```

Every layer breaks: `loadWeave`, `getState`, `buildLinkIndex`, all CLI commands, the VS Code tree provider, and all tests. The Loom repo's own `weaves/` docs also need migrating to the new layout.

---

### What should happen first

1. **Create `weave-and-thread-plan-001.md`** — careful, phased steps. The implementation order matters: core entities → fs `loadWeave` → `getState` → CLI → VS Code → tests → migrate existing docs.

2. **Decide the migration strategy for `weaves/`** — do we migrate our own design docs in-place as part of the implementation, or keep the existing flat layout until Phase 4 is complete? I'd recommend: implement Phase 4 against `j:/temp/loom` (test workspace), keep the real `weaves/` flat until everything is working, then migrate.

3. **One open plan to check first:** `weaves/core-engine/plans/enforce-single-primary-design-plan-001.md` — unclear if this is in-progress or obsolete given the "1 thread = 1 design" constraint is now settled. Worth deciding: close it or absorb into the Phase 4 plan.

---

### My recommendation

Don't start Phase 4 code yet. Start by creating `weave-and-thread-plan-001.md` together so we agree on the exact steps before anything breaks. This is the kind of refactor where the plan saves more time than it costs.

Should we draft that plan now?

## Rafa:
Sure, I never start this kind of big / important / core / refactor implementations withour a good detail plan with phases. But don't do it yet.
This is a big core change (and all layers as consequence) we should be sure this is for good and that the new structure will keep forever.
Tell me your sincere analisys.
Also if we ahead, we should tag something like `v0.2.0 before weave-threads`, agree?
## AI:

Sincere analysis follows.

---

### Is the model right?

Yes. The flat-per-weave layout is already breaking in practice. Look at `weaves/vscode-extension/`:

```
vscode-extension-design.md
vscode-extension-toolbar-design.md
vscode-extension-visual-design.md
vscode-extension-icons-design.md
vscode-extension-user-personalization-design.md
```

Five design docs in one flat weave. The tree provider picks `designs[0]` as "primary" — which is fragile and arbitrary. The more the project grows, the worse this gets. The Weave/Thread model resolves this cleanly: each of these becomes its own Thread subdirectory with exactly one design. The "1 thread = 1 design" constraint turns ambiguity into structure.

The metaphor (Weave = project, Thread = workstream, Fiber = document) is solid and consistent. I don't see a scenario where we'd need to revisit it. It's the right model.

---

### Is the cost justified?

The refactor is large but contained:
- **Core entities**: add `Thread` entity, update `Weave` to hold threads instead of flat docs
- **fs layer**: rewrite `loadWeave` to scan thread subdirectories
- **app layer**: update `getState`, `loadWeave` deps, use-cases
- **CLI**: update all commands that reference weave-level docs
- **VS Code**: update tree provider to render Weave → Threads → Docs
- **Tests**: rewrite all seed helpers and assertions
- **Docs migration**: reorganize `weaves/` own design docs into thread subdirectories

The test infrastructure we just built (workspace-workflow, Extension Host) makes the refactor safer — we have a real working harness to validate against. This is actually the best moment to do it: foundation is clean, tests are green, no feature work in-flight.

Deferring further only adds migration cost — more docs, more tests, more code all in the flat model.

---

### Will it "keep forever"?

The Weave/Thread/Fiber model as defined in `weave-and-thread-design.md` v3 is stable. The only open question from section 9 (loose fibers in thread folders) has a clear answer already (No). The settled decisions in 9a are solid. I see no reason this gets redesigned.

---

### On the tag

Agreed. The right sequence:
1. Tag `v0.2.0` now — marks the current working state (anchor-free + VS Code + tests all done)
2. Tag `v0.3.0-pre-weave-threads` just before Phase 4 code starts (after the plan is written and agreed)

This matches the precedent of `v0.2.0-pre-anchor-free`. Having both a clean release tag and a safety tag is the right pattern.

---

**Summary:** The model is right, the moment is right, the cost is real but bounded. Plan first, then execute. Tag before touching code.

## Rafa:
Create the plan with structured phased and detailed to approach a succeful migration of docs structure

## AI:
Draft plan written at weaves/core-engine/plans/weave-and-thread-plan-001.md.

Shape of the plan:

9 phases, 34 steps. Atomic steps, one commit each.
Feature branch strategy — main stays on flat layout until Phase 8 passes.
Loom's own weaves/ migrates last (Phase 8) — we build + test the new code against j:/temp/loom first, then run the migration script on our own docs.
Dry-run migration script (Phase 7) before touching real docs.
Six key decisions flagged at the bottom that I want your explicit OK on before we start — especially:

Default thread-from-name on loom weave idea "Foo Bar" → thread foo-bar (with --loose as opt-out)
promoteToDesign on a loose idea wrapping both into a new thread folder (recommendation b)
Chat file migration handling
Status is draft — review and tell me what to change.

Next: waiting for you to review the plan and confirm (or push back on) the 6 decisions.
