## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to a [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

---

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub.
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/reslava-loom.git
   cd reslava-loom
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
5. **Run tests** to verify everything works:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

---

## Development Setup

### VS Code Extension Development

The VS Code extension lives in the `packages/vscode/` directory. To develop and debug:

1. Open the project in VS Code.
2. Press `F5` to launch a new Extension Development Host window.
3. In the new window, open a test loom (e.g., `~/looms/test/`).
4. Use the "Loom" view in the Explorer sidebar.

**Recommended Extensions for Development:**
- ESLint
- Prettier
- TypeScript

### CLI Development

The CLI (`loom`) is built with TypeScript and `commander`. To test CLI changes locally:

```bash
npm run build:cli
npm link   # Makes `loom` available globally for testing
loom status
```

To unlink:
```bash
npm unlink -g @reslava-loom/cli
```

### Running in Watch Mode

For faster iteration:
```bash
npm run watch        # Rebuilds on file changes (extension)
npm run watch:cli    # Rebuilds CLI on file changes
```

## Architecture Principles

When contributing code, please adhere to the core architectural principles outlined in [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

### 1. Pure Reducers for State Changes
All logic that modifies document state **must** be a pure function located in `packages/core/src/*Reducer.ts`. These functions take a `BaseDoc` and an `Event` and return a new `BaseDoc`. They **must not** perform I/O.

### 2. Effects for Side Effects
File writes, command execution, and notifications belong in the **Effects Layer** (`packages/core/src/effects/`). Effects are executed after the reducer updates state.

### 3. Derived State is Computed, Not Stored
Never add a field like `thread.status` to a file on disk. Status is always derived by `packages/core/src/derived.ts`.

### 4. No Global State
The system does not use a central state object or database. State is read from the filesystem on demand (with caching for performance).

### 5. Multi‑Loom Resolution
The active loom is resolved by `packages/fs/src/utils.ts` → `getActiveLoomRoot()`. This function checks the global registry (`~/.loom/config.yaml`) and falls back to local `.loom/` discovery.

## Coding Standards

- **Language:** TypeScript (strict mode enabled).
- **Formatting:** Prettier (run `npm run format` before committing).
- **Linting:** ESLint (run `npm run lint`).
- **Commit Messages:** Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:
  - `feat(core): add REFINE_DESIGN reducer`
  - `fix(fs): resolve thread root from active loom`
  - `docs(readme): update CLI examples`
  - `refactor(cli): extract status command`

### Naming Conventions
- Files: `kebab-case.ts`
- Classes/Interfaces: `PascalCase`
- Functions/Variables: `camelCase`
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`

---

## Testing

### Unit Tests (Core Engine)
All pure functions in `packages/core` must have unit tests.

```bash
npm test -- --filter=@reslava-loom/core
```

Write tests in `packages/core/test/` using a structure that mirrors `src/`.

### Integration Tests (CLI & FS)
Tests that touch the filesystem should create temporary directories.

```bash
npm test -- --filter=@reslava-loom/fs
```

### Extension Tests
Extension tests run inside VS Code's Extension Host. We use `@vscode/test-electron`.

```bash
npm run test:extension
```

**Test Coverage Goals:**
- Core reducers: >90%
- Derived state functions: 100%
- CLI commands: Smoke tests for happy paths
